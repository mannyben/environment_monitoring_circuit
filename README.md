# environment_monitoring_circuit
 4 environment element measuring program for use with AtmelSAML21 and BME680 sensor. <br />
This program can detect the gas(ohms), pressure(hectopascals), temperature(degrees celcius) and humidity(relative humidity), 
of whatever environment the cirucit is in. 
Measurements displayed alternate between temperature/pressure and gas/humidity. <br /> 
Measurements are shown down to the hundreths of the corresponding unit. <br /> 
The required circuit for this needs 1 Atmel SAML21 MCU, 1 BME680 Sensor, and ST7036 Dot Matrix LCD Controller/Driver. <br />
Schematic can be found as a .pdf in the repo. <br />
